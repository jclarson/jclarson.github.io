# Name:

Pac-Men

# Description:

The goal of this project was to create multiple images and move them around the screen, changing direction when hitting screen edges.

# Installation:

Requires the index.html and pacmen.js files to be in the same directory, and a subdirectory called images containing the 4 PNG files.

# Usage:

Load the HTML file in a browser and click the "Add PacMan" button to add a PacMan.  Pressing the button repeatedly will add more PacMen of random sizes.
Click the "Start Game" button to have the PacMen move.  They will move at random speeds, and bounce off the walls.
