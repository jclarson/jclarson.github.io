# Name:

Watching Eyes

# Description:

The goal of this project was to have 2 "eyes" that follow the mouse as it moves around the screen.

# Installation:

Requires the index.html, styles.css and eyes.js files to be in the same directory.

# Usage:

Load the HTML file in a browser and move the mouse around to see the eyes follow the cursor.

# Support:

No support is provided for this application.  Use at your own discretion.

# Roadmap:

May eventually add additional elements to make it more like a face, or perhaps multiple sets of eyes in a dark room or jungle or something.
