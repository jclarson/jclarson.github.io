            <h2>Howdy!</h2>
            <p>My name is Jason Larson, and you've found my presence on the web.  It, like me, is a constant work in progress,
                so please forgive its less than perfect appearance.  I have been in the IT industry for over 25 years, providing
                support, implementing software, managing networks, administering domains and mail servers, securing access, and
                integrating data.  From early on, I found that I could improve parts of my work through automation and began
                teaching myself basic scripting skills.  I started with simple DOS batch files and learned bits and pieces of other
                languages along the way, including Pascal, FORTRAN, Visual Basic, Visual Basic for Applications, Perl, C++, PowerShell,
                SQL, and C#.  I discovered that I could use this knowledge not only to help myself, but also to help those with whom I
                worked.  Automating tasks had the obvious benefits of saving time, reducing errors, and thus saving the company money,
                but that wasn't what got me excited.  Helping people through automation has the added benefit of actually improving
                lives because it allows people to spend less time on things that are tedious and makes it such that they don't dread
                doing those tasks.  We spend so much of our time and energy at work, that if we can reduce our stress there, it can
                mean a measurable difference in the quality of our lives overall.</p>
            <p>At the moment, I am enrolled in an online program through MIT to learn full stack development with MERN.  At the end
                of the course, I will earn a Professional Certificate in Coding.  In addition to the certificate (and more importantly),
                I will have additional skills to allow me to move into a full time development position.  I am currently working for
                Education Advanced, a software company that empowers educators and transfors schools so that they can spend more time
                helping students.  As a developer, I will be able to have an even greater role in improving the lives of teachers, which
                will impact the lives of even more students, and eventually the world as a whole. Is this outlook too optimistic?  Maybe,
                but whether or not I impact the whole world, I know that I will be making a difference in the lives of our future generations,
                and I can't see a negative side to that.</p>
            <p>This site contains some of the projects I have been working on, both through the course, as well as on my own.  Have a look
                around, and come back later to see what else I've been able to accomplish.</p>
