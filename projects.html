            The original requirements were for displaying only one bus on the route.  I added all the buses, and updated the markers so that buses that were outbound
            (having a direction of 1) are black, and I rotated the markers so that the blue ones (with a direction of 0) point upwards to indicate their general path
            of travel on the route.
